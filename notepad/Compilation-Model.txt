Functions across Multiple Files:

Source Files    ->  Processing:
                        - #include replaced with the actual content of the included files

                        Translation Units  ->   Compilation:

                                                    Object  ->  Linking:
                                                                    - The linker searches for definitions in all translation units (.cpp) files in the project.
                                                                    - Does not have to live in a *.cpp file with the same name as the header


                                                        - Each object is a binary representation of it's translation unit.
                                                        - One object file per translation unit
