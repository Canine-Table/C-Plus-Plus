/*
    These are declarations also known as prototypes.
    You can declare as many times as you like but you can define only once.
    The prototype needs to come BEFORE the function call in your file.
    Otherwise the compilation will fail.

    One Definition Rule (OSR):
        The same function implementation can;t show up in the global nameplace more than once


    The full function definition coming in front of main() also doubles as a prototype(declaration).
    That's why the code in the last script worked without any issue

    NOTE:
        Signatures do not contain the return type
